 easy mode acounting-like application for simple transaction with multiple base account

Incomes & Expenses Insight is a good app: Fasten the creation of Transaction for all your daily need, as all income moves to a single Account, and expense comes from a single Account. I used it to track my Cash-in-hand. But then, I still needed to track my Bank account using other application. until in mid July 2015 i learned myself an Android Development with Java, and i want to add something usefull (to me at least): Multiple Bank account.

in every data input, the income & expense flow to a single account: the so-called Base account

Some people might said, it would be just the same as common accounting: input data which incomes equal expenses. But let's keep the simplicity of the application which aimed for daily simple transaction: in every data input, the income & expense flow to a single account: the so-called Base account The next simplicity is that the autogenerated reference number, which the user does not have to bother seing it, nor writing it himself. All s/he need to write is description, which is not even mandatory!
